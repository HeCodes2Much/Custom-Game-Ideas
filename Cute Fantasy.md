# Cute Fantasy — Full Game Summary (Offline Single-Player)

---

## 1. Game Overview

*Cute Fantasy* is a 2D pixel-art, offline single-player RPG inspired by MMORPG systems like Black Desert Online, but designed for simplicity and fun similar to Stardew Valley. The game features charming 64x64 sprites and focuses on deep character progression, strategic gear enhancement, and rich lore exploration—all without multiplayer or online components.

- **Dungeon ladder system** allows assigning up to 5 toons (excluding the logged-in toon) to off-screen dungeon runs for passive progression.

## 3. Stats, Combat Power (CP), and Area Access

- Core stats:  
  - **HP (Health Points)**  
  - **Stamina** (used for life skills, not combat)  
  - **Magika** (used for all attack skills)  
  - **AP (Attack Power)**  
  - **DP (Defense Power)**  
  - **Knowledge** (gained from monsters, unlocking lore and items)
- **Combat Power (CP)** is the sum of AP, DP, HP, MP (Magika Points), SP (Stamina Points), and Knowledge.
- Area access is gated by minimum CP requirements to ensure balanced progression.

---

## 4. Combat and Skills

- Real-time combat with simple mechanics inspired by Stardew Valley.
- All attack skills consume Magika.
- Stamina powers life skills like cooking and crafting.
- Pets, fairies, spirits, and potions provide buffs affecting combat, loot, and knowledge gain.

## 5. Knowledge System

---

## 6. Gear and Enhancement

- Gear levels from **1 to 20 (numeric)**, then can be **awakened** to levels **I through X (Roman numerals)**.
- Enhancement rules:  
  - Levels 1–10: +1 per success only, no downgrade on fail.  
  - Levels 11–20: +1 or small chance +2 per success; failure causes 1-level downgrade (never below 10).  
  - Awakened gear can downgrade 1 or 2 tiers on fail, never below tier I.
- **Soulbinding:** Gear binds to a toon once equipped; unlocking gear for other toons costs soul points earned by defeating world bosses.
